# Potato Disease Classification Using CNN  

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify diseases in potato plants. By training on a dataset of potato leaf images, the model identifies and categorizes various diseases affecting crops, providing a tool for early detection and intervention.  

## Overview  
Potato farming is a vital part of agriculture, but diseases can severely affect crop yield and quality. This project applies deep learning techniques to automate disease identification in potato plants. The trained CNN model can assist farmers in detecting issues early, enabling timely interventions and better crop management.  

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep neural network optimized for grid-like data, such as images. They excel at extracting features and recognizing patterns through layers such as:  
- **Convolutional Layers**: Detect features like edges, textures, and shapes.  
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining key features.  
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Make final predictions based on extracted features.  

These capabilities make CNNs an excellent choice for image classification tasks.  

## Dataset  
**Download link:** [Potato Leaf Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadardiputra/potato-leaf-disease-dataset)  

The dataset includes high-resolution images of potato leaves categorized into healthy and diseased classes. It is split into training and testing subsets for model development and evaluation.  

## Results  
The trained CNN model achieved an impressive **99% accuracy** on the test set. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations, such as confusion matrices and learning curves, are provided in the project notebooks.
